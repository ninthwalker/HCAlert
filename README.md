### Installation
Here is the link to add the HC Alert bot to your own discord server:  
[HC Alert Discord Bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1145545491237572688&permissions=18432&scope=bot)  

Permissions needed for the bot on the channel you set it to post in:  
```
Send Messages
Embed Links
```
  
Only requirement is for the server owner/admin to use the  `/hcalert set` command to configure the channel for the bot to post to. The other options for set are optional. Most of the /hcalert commands are self-explanatory or use `/hcalert help` for additional explanations.

## Bot Commands

**Primary slash command: `/hcalert`**

**Secondary optional settings:**  
- **Alert Type:** Death Only, Level Up Only, Death & Level Up. [Default: Death Only]
- **Minimum Level:** Minimum char level before any alert will occur. Min is 10. [Default is 10 for chars and 20 for guilds]
- **Level Increment:** For Level Up alerts, set this for how often to be alerted. [Default: 3]  
ie: If set to 2, alerts will go out for lvl's 10, 12, 14..
- **Guild:** Select `Yes` if this is a guild and not a character.

### Known Issues/Limitations
- Blizzard only updates on character logout
- Blizzard only tracks characters that are level 10+
- Guild limitations: Due to Blizzard API limits, guild minimum level is set to 20, there can only be one guild per discord server, and guilds are checked once an hour.
- If you die, logout, immediately delete and create a character with the same name before the API gets checked, the bot will not know of the death or be able to report it. Will think you are still whatever level you died at. To fix, use the `/hcalert remove` command to remove the character and then add it again. Alternatively, wait until you reach the level you died at again and the bot will resume reporting.
